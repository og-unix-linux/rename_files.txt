rename ACDC AC-DC ACDC*

rename 's/ACDC/AC-DC/' *.xxx

rename.ul ACDC AC-DC ACDC*

Current directory:

for file in ACDC*.xxx; do
    mv "$file" "${file//ACDC/AC-DC}"
done
Including subdirectories:

find . -type f -name "ACDC*" -print0 | while read -r -d '' file; do
    mv "$file" "${file//ACDC/AC-DC}"
done
Newline characters are really unlikely to be in filenames, so this can be simpler while still working with names containing spaces:

find . -type f -name "ACDC*" | while read -r file; do
    mv "$file" "${file//ACDC/AC-DC}"
done
